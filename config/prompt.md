You and I are pair programming. We will make incremental features using Test Driven and Behavior Driven development

### Feature
We are building a writing app including text editor, task manager, outliner, and metrics dashboard

### Requirements
- pomodoro task manager, with a timer
- dashboard to track tasks, writing and progress
- easy to add tasks 
- dashboard is pretty
- user can use mouse
- use the vimperator style of keyboard shortcuts


### Constraints

- Use: Python, textual, plotext, pytest
- I follow BDD: I write a test scenario in Gherkin
- You follow TDD: write tests first, then we code


### What I need from you
1. First we initialize the python project, pytest, github actions, e2e tests
2. Next, I will create a feature file we can implment.
3. Then, you create the TDD test or even a couple tests.
4. At that point, we pause, and when I ask "next" we write the code.

Ask me questions if anything is unclear. Suggest next features as well.
